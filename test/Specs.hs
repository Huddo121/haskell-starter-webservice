    We are running `hspec-discover` to generate the internals of this file, which will find all the Specs that
      meet the following criteria:

    - The file is in this directory, or lower
    - The file ends in 'Spec.hs'
    - The module exports `spec :: Spec`

    See http://hspec.github.io/hspec-discover.html for more info.
