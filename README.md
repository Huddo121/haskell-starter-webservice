## Building This Project

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) for its builds.

`nix build`

## Running the Server

Once you have built the server, you can run `./result/bin/my-awesome-ws`.

## Documentation Server

This project is able to serve swagger docs that are derived from the types of your routes and APIs. To start serving the
swagger-ui, run `nix-build`, then `./result/bin/docserver`. Swagger-ui will start running on
http://localhost:8443/swagger-ui.
